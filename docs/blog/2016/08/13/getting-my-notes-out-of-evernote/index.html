    <h2 id="the-why">The Why</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m an obsessive note taker. Meetings, ideas, to do lists, grocery lists&hellip; The act of writing really helps me remember, so I&rsquo;ve been writing everything down since I was a teenager.  For years I had a thousand text documents scattered around my computer. In 2008 I discovered that the act of writing isn&rsquo;t nearly as effective as the act of <em>searching</em>, so I resolved to start taking notes in a central, searchable, sync&rsquo;ed system. In short, I jumped on the Evernote train.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems like every time I turn around, Evernote has found some more bloat to add. First it was photos and videos, then to do lists and Reminders. Then came poorly-implemented sharing, groups, chat, geo-tagging, google drive integration, and so on. I recently heard that it does Salesforce integration, too. I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere out there, there&rsquo;s a target market that wants all of this shit every time they write a shopping list, but I am not in that market. I just want to write, sync, and search text.</p>
<p>I get to digress a little here, because it&rsquo;s my blog. I like simple, reliable tools that don&rsquo;t try to think for me. I write notes in a mix of 4 languages, so spellcheck is an automatic fail. Autocorrect is even worse. Grammar checkers make it impossible to mix short form and long form notes. I don&rsquo;t even want smart quotes. I&rsquo;m a programmer. When I type something in single quotes, I want it to <em>stay</em> in single quotes. In short, if your feature starts with the word &ldquo;smart&rdquo;, it can fuck off.</p>
<p>In the last several months I&rsquo;ve noticed that I have a thousand text notes on my computer again. It&rsquo;s not hard to see why: Evernote has gotten all &ldquo;smart&rdquo;. OSX&rsquo;s Textedit application can be configured to take the kind of simple notes I like, so that&rsquo;s what I found myself using. So I resolved to find a new note taking system.</p>
<h2 id="the-what">The What</h2>
<p>Here were my criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>ONLY text notes. I&rsquo;ve got other ways to handle pictures, drawings, geo-location, and to-do lists. This is just for text.</li>
<li>The ability to disable everything &ldquo;smart&rdquo; in the text editor. I don&rsquo;t even want smart URLs. Just text.</li>
<li>Automatically saves and syncs. Of the hundred or so text documents on my Desktop, 99% of them are called &ldquo;Untitled&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Searchable.</li>
<li>Accessible from my Phone and all of my computers</li>
<li>Starting a new note should be as easy as Ctrl+N</li>
<li>Easy to sync/share with my wife</li>
<li>Ability to write to a note from the terminal or any other application.</li>
</ul>
<p>I considered just using vim, but my vim environment is way too feature-packed for what I want. I used vim as an IDE for a long time, remember? I have similar issues with Atom and Emacs - they just do way more than I want them to. Simple, simple, simple!</p>
<p>I chose Simplenote on the recommendation of a few like-minded people, and I love it so far. But of course, there&rsquo;s some migration to take care of!</p>
<h2 id="the-how">The How</h2>
<p>Out of the box, Simplenote is a great note-taking tool for my purposes. I had to disable some of the usual &ldquo;smart&rdquo; features, but it took me less than 30 seconds to find and disable them. No biggie. It was missing two key features, though: the ability to write from the terminal, and my long history of Evernote documents.</p>
<p>The solution to both involves an undocumented feature of Simplenote: Dropbox integration. Send an email to customer support and ask for them to enable it on your account. It&rsquo;s rudimentary, and as their support rep explained to me, &ldquo;this feature isn’t really something we can support, its more of a convenience thing we’ve added for you.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m cool with that.</p>
<p>Just like that, I have a note-taking system that does two-way sync to a folder of .txt files on all my devices. I can create txt files any way I like, of course: pipe data from the terminal, have PHP write debug output, or use a totally different text editor. That&rsquo;s a huge feature add! It also adds some other nice features, like now my wife can share my notes. Oh, and Spotlight will search those notes automatically, too. Sweet.</p>
<p>Importing from Evernote was a bit of a bitch. Evernote lets you export notebooks to HTML, or HTML wrapped in a custom XML format (.enex, because the world needs another file extension). Neither of those are terribly helpful. I tried a couple of options that failed out on my system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/claytron/ever2simple">Ever2simple</a>, which promises to convert .enex into a directory of Markdown text files, wouldn&rsquo;t install because libxml is a tricky beast on OSX. Then it wouldn&rsquo;t run because libxml is a tricky beast on OSX. I gave up.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.geeknote.me/">Geeknote</a>, the Evernote command line client, which promises to export to txt files. No installation instructions for non-Linux users, requires python-setuptools which is tricky to get on OSX, and wants sudo access for the installer script without explaining why. Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>I finally stumbled on a little PHP project called <a href="https://github.com/panicsteve/enex-dump">enexdump</a>. One file, no installation, written in my most comfortable language after English. Less than 100 lines of code. Perfect! It worked like a charm.</p>
<p><code>php enex-dump.php ~/Desktop/my-notes.enex</code></p>
<p>And a couple of minutes later, I had an /output folder full of txt files.</p>
<p>So far I can only recommend this setup. Have fun!</p>
