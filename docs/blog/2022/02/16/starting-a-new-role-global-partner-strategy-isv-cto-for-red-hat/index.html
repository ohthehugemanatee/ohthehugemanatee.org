    <p>This month I start a new challenge at Microsoft, as <strong>Global Partner Strategy ISV CTO</strong> for Red Hat. Translated: I am taking on technical leadership of the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2015/11/04/microsoft-and-red-hat-partner-to-deliver-more-flexibility-and-choice/">Microsoft/Red Hat partnership</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/microsoft-redhat-puzzle.jpg" alt="Microsoft and Red Hat logos as puzzle pieces fitting together" title="The Microsoft-Red Hat partnership"></p>
<p>I had a wonderful and fruitful 4 years as a technical and team lead in the Commercial Software Engineering department, continuing my project-based work with some of Microsoft&rsquo;s biggest commercial customers. I got to build interesting projects with brilliant engineers, working in close collaboration with Volkswagen, Daimler, E.ON, the United Nations, and others. I got to learn what it&rsquo;s like working in an enormous company like Microsoft, and how global enterprises engage with each other.</p>
<p>Working with Red Hat is an exciting next step for me. Red Hat 5.2 was my first exposure to Linux back in 1998, and though I never did get it working successfully, I tried again a couple of years later and built my first homemade router and file server on 6.1. It was my go-to distro for years: when I ran a research lab in university, the systems and servers were all Red Hat 8. If someone had told me back then, that 20 years later <em>this</em> would be my job, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it.</p>
<p>I feel like my life has completed one of those little circles, and I am over the moon about where I landed.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Red Hat have a lot in common: they are both enterprise focused, with strong technical fundamentals in infrastructure and cloud native in particular. Of all the hyperscalers Azure is the one that treats hybrid cloud as a first class citizen, and not just an onramp to public cloud. Red Hat is also hybrid focused, with a suite of powerful products  including Openshift, Ansible, and others. Though Microsoft has made great leaps in open source, we have a lot to learn by working closely with a company for whom open source principles are truly fundamental. And enterprise-focused though RedHat is, no one meets enterprise where they live as well as Microsoft.</p>
<p>With all this in common, and so much to learn from each other, the partnership is already a warm and welcoming place to land. In my first weeks here it is clear that this is very fertile ground. Look for exciting things to come!</p>
<p>Thank you to all my colleagues from Microsoft Commercial Software Engineering. I had a lot of fun with you, and learned a lot. On to the next adventure!</p>
