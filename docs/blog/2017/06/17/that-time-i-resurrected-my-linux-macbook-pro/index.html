  <div class="post">
    <p>In the airport last week, my laptop stopped booting.</p>
<p>I have a 2012 Macbook Pro - yes, that coveted &ldquo;last good model&rdquo; - and it runs Ubuntu Linux. It&rsquo;s my roving office as I travel the world to conferences, performances, and job sites. So when I started it up at JFK airport this week and got a gray screen of death, I was a little concerned.</p>
<p>I tried starting into Startup Manager by holding the &ldquo;Option&rdquo; key. No bootable options appeared. Just an unhopeful file folder with a question mark. This was Not A Good Sign.</p>
<p><img src="/images/folder-questionmark.jpg" alt="When this is all your computer does, it is Not A Good Sign."></p>
<p>Generally this icon means that EFI couldn&rsquo;t find a valid startup device. This is not the first time I&rsquo;ve seen this - I&rsquo;ve played with my boot options enough to mess this up for myself a few times! I breathed a heavy sigh and tried starting onto the recovery partition by holding &ldquo;Command+R&rdquo;. I hadn&rsquo;t done anything in particular with Grub recently, but I had done some kernel updates, and you never know&hellip; But the recovery boot just got me a circle with a line through it, the universal &ldquo;no&rdquo; sign. This was an even worse sign.</p>
<p><img src="/images/mac-no-sign.png" alt="This is an Even Worse Sign."></p>
<p>This immediately threw the issue out of the realm of &ldquo;something I messed up myself&rdquo;, and into the less-entertaining realm of &ldquo;hardware failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At home I have some tools for diagnosing this sort of issue, but in the airport I had limited options - and unlimited time. So I started into Apple&rsquo;s built in Diagnostic Test mode by holding &ldquo;D&rdquo;. A lesser-known feature of the Apple boot manager, is that if it doesn&rsquo;t have a device to boot from, it can download an image from the Internet, load it into RAM, and boot from there. I had never had the chance to try it out before, but that didn&rsquo;t give much satisfaction as I grimly waited for it to work it&rsquo;s magic.</p>
<p>The diagnostic report looked fine, everything in tip-top shape! That is, until I went to the hard drive diagnostic page - there wasn&rsquo;t one. Not just no hard drive diagnostic, but completely no page for SATA diagnostics at all.</p>
<p>At this point it was clear that a catastrophic hard disk failure was my best-case scenario. Maybe it just skipped the drive diagnostic because no devices reported back, I hoped. There&rsquo;s something zen in that moment, when you find yourself <em>hoping</em> that you&rsquo;ve <em>only</em> lost your entire hard drive. All my work is backed up and relatively accessible, after all; I could stare digital death in the eye with only a hundred-Euro bill for a new drive. A motherboard failure, though - I tried not to think of it.</p>
<p>When I got home, I pulled out my toolkit. I opened up my mac to look for signs of burnout or other damage. Nothing. No smell, no scorches, no scratches. Not even any capacitor whine. I have a lot of respect for the engineers who designed a system that, even after 5 years of hard abuse, still retained it&rsquo;s &ldquo;new motherboard smell.&rdquo; I optimistically tried re-seating the SATA cable for my drive, but wasn&rsquo;t surprised when that didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I opened my desktop gaming computer, and plugged my laptop hard disk in there. I got the worst result possible from this test: the drive worked fine. It booted into my beautifully customized Linux desktop, dutifully selecting a random background image from the Internet - as luck would have it, a man screaming at his laptop in frustration. Though everyone knows that the silicon gods have a strong sense of irony.</p>
<p>I did a couple of follow up tests to confirm the diagnosis, but it was clear: the hard drive was fine, it was the SATA controller on my Macbook that had died. Everything else seemed intact; I could boot from a USB stick just fine, with a reasonable performance degradation (there&rsquo;s a ~33% speed difference between SATA3 and USB3 interfaces). But it couldn&rsquo;t detect anything connected internally.</p>
<p>The first goal was to get myself a computer for work. I&rsquo;m a contractor, which means that I don&rsquo;t take days off if I can help it. So I threw together a nice looking machine from spare parts I had laying around the house, and used my ex-laptop hard drive as a primary. When it first booted, I confess to a very satisfying &ldquo;I told you those parts would come in handy someday&rdquo; jab to my wife. She was very impressed, I could tell from the way she rolled her eyes at me. :)</p>
<p>My immediate need of a working machine for the office satisfied, the second priority was to buy a new laptop. I&rsquo;m on the road <strong>a lot</strong>. A desktop working environment - even one that lets me cheerfully tease my partner a little - is a band-aid at best. In fact, my next onsite was in Zürich in two weeks! I briefly considered taking my tower carry-on, before buckling down to find a computer.</p>
<p>My local electronics shop was a bust. They had plenty of beautiful looking machines that would run Linux perfectly nicely - those Lenovos are really coming along! - but they all had one fatal flaw: I can&rsquo;t work on a German keyboard.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Germany for 6 years now; I&rsquo;m comfortable in the language and culture, and I can complain about the bureaucracy with the best of them. But I just can&rsquo;t handle their terrible keyboard layout. QWERTZ might be fine for writing the language, but code and the *nix terminal are very QWERTY-centric. No, there was no way I would put up with a QWERTZ laptop for my next 5 years.</p>
<p>So I bought one of the popular Dell XPS 13 &ldquo;developer edition&rdquo; laptops, with Ubuntu pre-installed. I excitedly checked my order status right away, and saw the shipping date&hellip; was the day after I leave for Zürich. Shit.</p>
<p>So my old laptop is back in service, limping along for one last hurrah. The black box on the back looks like some impressive hardware hack, but it&rsquo;s just the old internal drive connected by USB.</p>

<p>Yes, I had to do the GRUB dance pretty extensively to get it booting. boot-repair is a wonderful tool, but nothing seems to handle elegantly switching between BIOS and EFI boot modes. I ended up having to copy EFI files from my USB stick by hand. As every Linux desktop user ever has said: &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s working I won&rsquo;t ask any questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, I will take this computer into a board room in two weeks.</p>
<p>No, I am not ashamed. I&rsquo;m actually pretty satisfied with myself. It&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve built a computer myself, let alone rigged one up with duct tape and spare parts. It&rsquo;s been ages since I&rsquo;ve had to dig around in the Linux boot process (greatly improved since 2005, Linus be praised). And it&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve sported duct tape on my computer.</p>
<p>In a couple weeks I&rsquo;ll find out just how much special sauce Dell has put into their default Ubuntu setup to make it run. My setup is&hellip; not very default.</p>
