    <p>The proposal for a directive on copyright in the digital single market is disastrous for the <strong>EU economy, culture, and democracy in the digital world</strong>. It is particularly bad for my country of Germany, as a leading light in Europe in all three areas. I am writing all of my MEPs listed in support of this impossibly bad proposal.</p>
<p>The German and European economies would be terribly damaged by this article, which <strong>effectively rules out small and medium sized competition in favor of the largest incumbents</strong>. I work for Microsoft on precisely the kind of machine-understanding tasks involved in the copyright filter requirement. I can tell you with authority: <strong>it is an impossible task which only the deepest pockets can approach</strong>. <strong>Article 17 makes Germany and Europe into hostile venues for Internet startups</strong>. The next generation of Youtubes, Soundclouds, and Netflixes are not possible under this Article - unless of course, it&rsquo;s an existing mega-corporation who decides to start it. <strong>This is a tremendous handicap in the fastest growing sector of the global economy.</strong></p>
<p>The disaster for culture exemplifies the impossibility of such a filter. My &ldquo;side business&rdquo; is an entertainment company, making opera music accessible for tens of thousands of Europeans every year. The entire classical music industry opposes digital filters because we all know the consequence: <strong>a machine or untrained human can&rsquo;t tell the difference between the 300 different versions of Bach&rsquo;s Wohl Temperierte Klavier</strong>. The piece is identified as probably copyrighted because copyrighted versions exist, and taken down as a precaution. <strong>Famously even the European anthem, <em>An die Freude</em>, suffers automated takedowns</strong> because there are copyrighted versions of the piece. <strong>Asking platforms to bulk-police content means that the more influential a piece of music is for our culture - that is to say, the more versions of it exist - the more prone it is to spurious blocking on copyright grounds.</strong></p>
<p>As much as the technical infeasibility and halting the spread of the most important pieces of our European culture bother me,** the effect on democracy in the digital age is the worst part of this Article. User-generated content is foundational to online discussion**. It is precisely this content which enriches online debate and engagement, which reaches younger generations and pulls them into a very participatory democratic environment. You&rsquo;ve no doubt heard that **memes are culture**, but **they are also the medium of exchange in the biggest democratic commons humankind has ever created**. Legislation which shuts down this medium of exchange, or which forces the commons into channels controlled by the largest (foreign) economic actors in history, is bad for the EU.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps the world needs a digital copyright equivalent of Brexit</strong>, to scare everyone else away from the copyright lobby. Perhaps we all need a material example to see just how poorly the copyright lobby&rsquo;s 1960&rsquo;s-era ideology fits the 21st century economy.</p>
<p><strong>But I would prefer it not be my country, my continent that makes an example of itself.</strong></p>
<p>Please heed <a href="https://saveyourinternet.eu/statements/">the warnings from internet experts, the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, NGOs, programmers, and academics</a>. I urge you to reconsider your position on this digital Brexit.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Campbell Vertesi</p>
<p>Berlin, Germany</p>
