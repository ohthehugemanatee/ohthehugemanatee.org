        My client bought a domain name based on her favorite username when she was young. Like any teenager, she didn&rsquo;t choose the best name. But SpongeBobLover16 (name changed to preserve her anonymity) wanted to exert her online independence. She decided she would give her real name domain to SpongeBobLover16.com in a 301 redirect. Her parents told her she should always use a 302, but she ignored their advice. &ldquo;I remember it felt so good,&rdquo; she says today, &ldquo;but now I have to live with that mistake every day.

        The Why I&rsquo;m an obsessive note taker. Meetings, ideas, to do lists, grocery lists&hellip; The act of writing really helps me remember, so I&rsquo;ve been writing everything down since I was a teenager. For years I had a thousand text documents scattered around my computer. In 2008 I discovered that the act of writing isn&rsquo;t nearly as effective as the act of searching, so I resolved to start taking notes in a central, searchable, sync&rsquo;ed system.

        About a month and a half ago, I left my position at Forum One to start work on a project with Amazee Labs. Yes, a month and a half is an eternity in Internet-Time, but better to blog about it late than not at all!
I loved my position at Forum One. I got to work with worthwhile clients like Oxfam and United Way, I got to solve interesting and tricky Drupal problems, and I got to work with some truly brilliant colleagues.

        Today I got to generate git statistics for my team. It&rsquo;s more fun than it sounds! First of all, it&rsquo;s always entertaining to learn just how flexible git&rsquo;s reporting can get. Secondly, it&rsquo;s a chance to dive back into my old sysadmin tool kit and play with awk, sed, and friends.
There were a few questions I wanted to answer about one particular developer&rsquo;s input. I&rsquo;m concerned that he is working too much after hours.

        Dear Wired - I read your post about the changes in ad blocker policy on your site. Thanks for writing in such an open and respectful tone; it&rsquo;s clear you care about your readers and want to find a reasonable way forward.
Unfortunately the post fails to address the REASONS that your readers use ad blockers. If only you had gone a little bit farther in the post and offered specific promises in exchange for being whitelisted, I think you would keep a much larger proportion of your readers.

        Today I read a great blog post from Dries: Should we decouple Drupal with a client side framework?. As usual, Dries puts a lot of thought into his writing, and braves a shitstorm of responses by laying his thinking bare while he&rsquo;s still mulling it over. I couldn&rsquo;t resist adding to the storm.
I completely agree that Drupal would benefit from figuring out a standardized approach to decoupled front ends. I think Dries is spot-on in supporting a &ldquo;progressive decoupling&rdquo; model as a great best-of-both-worlds response that can happen within 8.

        Last night (my time) I got the good news over twitter:
That&rsquo;s right, Drupal 8 has it&rsquo;s first release. But what does that mean? Is it done? Can I start using it yet? What kind of changes are coming? Will dawehner get to sleep, at last?
Are we there yet? Despite all the rejoicing on social media, this isn&rsquo;t the final release for Drupal 8 - it&rsquo;s only the first Release Candidate.

        Last night I installed OSX&rsquo;s new &ldquo;El Capitain&rdquo; update, and it broke most of the tools I use in my daily life as a developer, including homebrew and git. Here are the steps I had to follow to get everything working again.
 Disable System Integrity Protection   System Integrity Protection is a new feature of OSX, also called &ldquo;rootless.&rdquo; As the nickname suggests, it creates another level of access above your root account.

        Everyone is excited these days about the death of ESPN, particularly as evidence of the death of &ldquo;bundle priced&rdquo; Cable TV. Consumers are supposed to be excited that soon they will only have to pay for the content they want. Don&rsquo;t get too excited yet.
Let&rsquo;s remember the basic purpose of bundled cable TV: for content producers, cable company bundles provide an easy, single outlet for their content. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;somebody else&rdquo; who will get the content to their viewers, sell advertising, and collect payment.

        One of the most exciting parts about the switch to Drupal 8 is the rapprochement of the Drupal community with the rest of PHP. This weekend I spoke at the Dutch PHP Conference in Amsterdam, where I got to be part of the vanguard of Drupalists reconnecting with the larger PHP world. The experience had a big impact on my perspective of the future of Drupal as a platform and as a community.
