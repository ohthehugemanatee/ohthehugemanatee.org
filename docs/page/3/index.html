        The Crellpocalypse in the Drupal world last week has shaken the entire community. This event and its handling have called our fundamental values and structures into question. We&rsquo;ve had fights on social media, calls for Dries to step down, and valuable contributors stepping away from the community. I have friends on every side of the situation, but all I can think is: This seems like the perfect time for a singing, dancing, spandexed pageant about the Drupal community.

        If you believe the docs and the twitters, there is no way to automate letsencrypt certificates updates on platform.sh. You have to create the certificates manually, upload them manually, and maintain them manually.
But as readers of this blog know, the docs are only the start of the story. I&rsquo;ve really enjoyed working with platform.sh with one of my private clients, and I couldn&rsquo;t believe that with all the flexibility - all the POWER - letsencrypt was really out of reach.

        In any decoupled architecture, people tend to focus on the pieces that will fit together. But what nobody ever tells you is: watch out for the cracks!
The cracks are the integration points between the different components. It&rsquo;s not GraphQL as a communication layer; it&rsquo;s that no one thinks to log GraphQL inconsistencies when they occur. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;what&rsquo;s my development environment&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;how do these three development environments work on my localhost at the same time?

        A year ago I proposed a session for Drupalcon Mumbai and Drupalcon New Orleans, called &ldquo;The best of both worlds&rdquo;. It promised to show attendees how to write Drupal 8 code for Drupal 7 sites. I never ended up giving the session, but this week I got an email asking for more information. So in case it ever comes up again, here&rsquo;s my own collection of resources on the subject.

        The developer world is abuzz with criticism of the new Macbook Pro. After 4 years of waiting for an update, what we got has two less ports, slower memory and a worse GPU, is a vanity project that the core demographic of Apple’s customers probably won’t even use, in the final balance: merely consumer-level. It&rsquo;s slammed as incompatible, absurd, and for pros&hellip; actually an insult.
If you&rsquo;re a developer in late 2016, and are in the market for a new laptop, there are some great options out there.

        A few months ago I posted about my frustrations getting El Capitan working with my relatively simple developer needs. At the time I complained about the direction Apple is going. One of these days, I threatened, I would jump back to Linux as a primary desktop environment.
This week I read about everyone&rsquo;s problems getting OSX Sierra going, and I decided it was time to take the plunge. Apple, I completely understand the direction you are going with your environment.

        My client bought a domain name based on her favorite username when she was young. Like any teenager, she didn&rsquo;t choose the best name. But SpongeBobLover16 (name changed to preserve her anonymity) wanted to exert her online independence. She decided she would give her real name domain to SpongeBobLover16.com in a 301 redirect. Her parents told her she should always use a 302, but she ignored their advice. &ldquo;I remember it felt so good,&rdquo; she says today, &ldquo;but now I have to live with that mistake every day.

        The Why I&rsquo;m an obsessive note taker. Meetings, ideas, to do lists, grocery lists&hellip; The act of writing really helps me remember, so I&rsquo;ve been writing everything down since I was a teenager. For years I had a thousand text documents scattered around my computer. In 2008 I discovered that the act of writing isn&rsquo;t nearly as effective as the act of searching, so I resolved to start taking notes in a central, searchable, sync&rsquo;ed system.

        About a month and a half ago, I left my position at Forum One to start work on a project with Amazee Labs. Yes, a month and a half is an eternity in Internet-Time, but better to blog about it late than not at all!
I loved my position at Forum One. I got to work with worthwhile clients like Oxfam and United Way, I got to solve interesting and tricky Drupal problems, and I got to work with some truly brilliant colleagues.

        Today I got to generate git statistics for my team. It&rsquo;s more fun than it sounds! First of all, it&rsquo;s always entertaining to learn just how flexible git&rsquo;s reporting can get. Secondly, it&rsquo;s a chance to dive back into my old sysadmin tool kit and play with awk, sed, and friends.
There were a few questions I wanted to answer about one particular developer&rsquo;s input. I&rsquo;m concerned that he is working too much after hours.
