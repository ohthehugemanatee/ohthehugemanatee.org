Steve Wozniak has an excellent Open Letter up on the Atlantic about the issue. &nbsp;He takes the examples of public goods such as roadworks and compares them favorably to privately managed utilities like Cable TV and Internet. Personally, I think his letter is a much more effective critique of the FCC than it is a championing of the public works model of construction.
