LDAP is, as you might have guessed, a directory protocol. &nbsp;It was developed in response to X.

Dependencies
Before you begin, you will need:
Amazon's standard EC2 Command Line ToolsAlestic's ebs-consistent-snapshot programTech Kismet's remove-old-snapshots.php script (which must be so named)

AMI Images
Everyone knows that Amazon Instances are ephemeral.

Amazon Web Services has a great little load balancer system you can use. &nbsp;A few clicks, and you're away to the races with a shiny load balancer of your own! &nbsp;The best part? &nbsp;It will even do SSL termination at the load balancer for you. &nbsp;Just paste in your certs and away you go!

        {% raw %} It's a familiar problem - you can't really host multiple SSL sites on a single IP address. &nbsp;There's a fancy workaround if you get a pricey multi-domain certificate, of course. &nbsp;But separate sites, with separate certificates just won't work. &nbsp;The reason is simple - put yourself in Apache's shoes.
When you're using name based virtualhosts, Apache uses the request headers to determine which vhost should get the request.
