        {% raw %} Ouch, Sony. Hot on the heels of the last 4 hacks have come another two in a row. Sony BMG Greece was hacked on Monday, and now Sony BMG Japan.
Though I stand by my comments from my earlier post (see: What the Sony hacks tell us about their Sysadmins and Management), there is another important dimension to this story. That's the dimension of a feeding frenzy.

        {% raw %} Varnish is a fantastic caching proxy, commonly used for CMSes. It's not uncommon to see benchmarks boasting 300-500 page loads per second - I've seen benches up to 5000 hits per second. That's faster than serving flat HTML from Apache; we're talking about a serious benefit to your server load here.
Part of Varnish's tremendous speed comes from how lean it is. At only 58,000 lines of code, it's very lightweight.

1) They're powerless in their own organization.
2) They don't get to set IT resource policy.

Amazon's standard EC2 Command Line ToolsAlestic's ebs-consistent-snapshot programTech Kismet's remove-old-snapshots.php script (which must be so named)

AMI Images
Everyone knows that Amazon Instances are ephemeral.

        {% raw %} It's a familiar problem - you can't really host multiple SSL sites on a single IP address. &nbsp;There's a fancy workaround if you get a pricey multi-domain certificate, of course. &nbsp;But separate sites, with separate certificates just won't work. &nbsp;The reason is simple - put yourself in Apache's shoes.
When you're using name based virtualhosts, Apache uses the request headers to determine which vhost should get the request.
