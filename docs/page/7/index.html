Foolishly, I uninstalled it the way you uninstall everything on OSX: by dragging it's Application icon to the Trash. I thought it was gone for good... it wasn't until weeks later that I noticed my system would gradually slow down after boot.
This is a brand new Macbook Pro, so there's no good reason for slow down.

        {% raw %} I recently took over an aging Drupal module, Resource Conflict. It had a D6 version with a lot of outstanding bugs in the queue... I started by simply rewriting it for D7 and my specific use case, but ended up in a discussion with the module's old maintainer about a total rewrite for&nbsp;Entities&nbsp;and&nbsp;Rules. So that's what I did, and I just released the 7.x-3.x-dev version.
Resource Conflict USED to be a module that detected booking conflicts in resources, and threw a form error.

Though I stand by my comments from my earlier post (see: What the Sony hacks tell us about their Sysadmins and Management), there is another important dimension to this story. That's the dimension of a feeding frenzy.

It's not uncommon to see benchmarks boasting 300-500 page loads per second - I've seen benches up to 5000 hits per second. That's faster than serving flat HTML from Apache; we're talking about a serious benefit to your server load here.
Part of Varnish's tremendous speed comes from how lean it is. At only 58,000 lines of code, it's very lightweight.
