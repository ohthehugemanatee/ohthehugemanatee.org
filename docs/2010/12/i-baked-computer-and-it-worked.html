This weekend a friend asked me to have a look at his <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/hp-compaq/152879-hp-dv9500.html">HP DV9500</a> laptop. &nbsp;It was having trouble - when you turned it on, the screen showed nothing but a solid grey with a few thin black bars. &nbsp;The grey increased in intensity as the system ran, until it ran off the colors that the display knew how to show.<br /><br />Clearly, there was a problem with the video card.<br /><br />I tried plugging it into an external monitor, and lo and behold, the system was actually booting fine! &nbsp;Just the video card had lost the ability to send a coherent signal to the built-in screen. &nbsp;I thought this might be a problem with the connection inside the laptop body, but then my friend explained what HP had told him.<br /><br /><a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Display-and-video/hp-dv9500-screen-problem/m-p/37120">This was a factory defect</a>. &nbsp;DV9500 laptops that shipped with the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/page/geforce8.html">NVIDIA 8600GS</a> video card tend to run into the mysterious "grey screen with black bars" problem about 2 years in. &nbsp;Oddly enough, 2 years is the limit on the standard HP warranty. &nbsp;People within warranty have the laptop replaced for free. &nbsp;For people outside of warranty, it costs 570€. &nbsp;My friend was in the latter, SOL category.<br /><br />So I looked into the problem a little bit deeper. According to my google search, the problem is actually that the solder joints between the GPU and the motherboard use a kind of solder that doesn't stand up to high temperatures very well. &nbsp;High temperatures like those that might be generated in a compact body laptop with a powerful GPU in it! &nbsp;<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Display-and-video/hp-dv9500-screen-problem/m-p/190057">The solder balls up or cracks</a>, making the GPU prone to failure. &nbsp;So to fix the problem all you have to do is re-solder all the connections between the GPU and the motherboard, ideally using a kind of solder that handles high temperatures better or forcing the GPU fan to run faster. &nbsp;Easy, right? &nbsp; Hahahahaha no.<br /><br />One forum user suggested a solution, I think in jest: just <a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Hardware/Pavillion-dv9500-WON-T-START/td-p/194528">put the motherboard in the oven</a>! &nbsp;The heat will melt the solder, and it will fill in any cracks. &nbsp;But people tried it, and reported that it worked for them. &nbsp;So with nothing to lose, we tried the same.<br /><br />Easier said than done - of all the laptops I've disassembled, the DV9500 has got to be the worst. &nbsp;22 screws for the underside exterior alone, and 3 more layers to get through after that! &nbsp;Probably about 75 screws to keep track of in the end. &nbsp;Plus you have to peel off all the anti-static plastic they've got glued to the motherboard, and remember where all THAT goes... I found this<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8CGafMQaq4"> disassembly video for a similar model</a> to be very helpful in reminding me where all the screws and plastic went when it came time to piece it back together.<br /><br />Here are your steps to baking a repaired HP DV9500/NVIDIA 8600GS:<br /><br /><ol><li>Get the motherboard out of the case. &nbsp;We want <b>just the motherboard</b>, with no plastic, screws, or additional parts. This is a pain in the ass. &nbsp;As you remove the screws, lay them out on a flat surface in some semblance of their layout on the actual laptop. &nbsp;Don't be afraid to a map for each layer - there are a LOT of screws on this guy, and you don't want to forget what goes where!&nbsp;</li><li>Pre-heat your oven to 175-200 degrees Celsius (350-390 degrees Fahrenheit).</li><li>Ball up 4 pieces of tin foil into cone shapes, and place them on a baking sheet. &nbsp;Place the pointy end of the cones on screw points on the motherboard. &nbsp;This is because screw points are lined and electrically insulated from the rest of the mobo - we don't want any solder dripping down!</li><li>Put the motherboard in the oven for 6-8 minutes. Set a timer. &nbsp;You will smell burning plastic after about 3 minutes - don't worry.</li><li>Remove the motherboard, and set it out to cool for 30 minutes. &nbsp;I put mine outside in the winter air for 10 minutes, same effect. :)</li><li>Piece your laptop back together, and hope!</li></ol><div>It took me 45 minutes to piece the laptop back together, cursing the whole time. &nbsp;But when I finally turned it on, and the screen WORKED... I couldn't believe it. &nbsp;My friend started jumping up and down, I beamed like an idiot, and his shy, reserved wife gave me a kiss. &nbsp;I was a hero, for baking their computer.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is one of the most bizarre tricks I've ever used to fix a computer, and I just had to share.&nbsp;</div>
