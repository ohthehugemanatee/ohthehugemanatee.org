      <description>I talk a fair bit about the connections between music and engineering, and a discussion on Hacker News came up about one of my favorite points. I&amp;rsquo;ve adapted my comments here.

This is mistaking the finger for the moon. Music, of any genre, is never about reproducing the notes and dynamics accurately.</description>
