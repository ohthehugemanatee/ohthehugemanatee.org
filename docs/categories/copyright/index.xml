      <description>The proposal for a directive on copyright in the digital single market is disastrous for the EU economy, culture, and democracy in the digital world. It is particularly bad for my country of Germany, as a leading light in Europe in all three areas. I am writing all of my MEPs listed in support of this impossibly bad proposal.
The German and European economies would be terribly damaged by this article, which effectively rules out small and medium sized competition in favor of the largest incumbents.</description>
