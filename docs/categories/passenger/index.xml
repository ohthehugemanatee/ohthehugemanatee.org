      <description>{% raw %} Redmine is a fantastic project management tool for technically oriented organizations. &amp;nbsp;At my job, we use it to manage 30-50 active projects at a time, as well as the back history of several hundred projects. &amp;nbsp;Oddly enough, the normal installation process puts it on port 3000 . &amp;nbsp;We had some trouble with developers&#39; ISPs not allowing HTTPS traffic over non-standard ports, so we had to move redmine onto port 443 along with the rest of the SSL traffic.</description>
