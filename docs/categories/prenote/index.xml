      <description>Recently some of my work on prenotes came up, and reminded me that I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to post favorite moments here for some time. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, a prenote is a session before the keynote of a conference or event. During that session, notables from across the community put on a humorous show of parody lyrics karaoke, terribly scripted dialogue, and general silliness. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to kick off an event, and really sets the tone if you&amp;rsquo;re into flat-hierarchy and openness for newbies.</description>
