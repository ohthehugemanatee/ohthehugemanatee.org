      <description>One of my holiday projects was to set up my home &amp;ldquo;data warehouse.&amp;rdquo; Ever since Dropbox killed modern Linux filesystem support I&amp;rsquo;ve been using (and loving) Nextcloud from my home. It backs up to an encrypted Duplicati store on Azure blob store, so that&amp;rsquo;s offsite backups taken care of. But it was time to knit all my various drives together into a single RAID data warehouse. The only problem: how to transfer my 2 terabytes (rounded to make the math in the post easier) of data, without nasty downtime during the holidays?</description>
