      <description>Recently some of my work on prenotes came up, and reminded me that I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to post favorite moments here for some time. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, a prenote is a session before the keynote of a conference or event. During that session, notables from across the community put on a humorous show of parody lyrics karaoke, terribly scripted dialogue, and general silliness. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to kick off an event, and really sets the tone if you&amp;rsquo;re into flat-hierarchy and openness for newbies.</description>

      <title>Drupal Does Face Recognition: Introducing Image Auto Tag module</title>
      <link>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/blog/2018/04/19/face-recognition-on-drupal/</link>

      <guid>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/blog/2018/04/19/face-recognition-on-drupal/</guid>
      <description>Last week I wrote a Drupal module that uses face recognition to automatically tag images with the people in them. You can find it on Github, of course. With this module, you can add an image to a node, and automatically populate an entity_reference field with the names of the people in the image. This isn&amp;rsquo;t such a big deal for individual nodes of course; it&amp;rsquo;s really interesting for bulk use cases, like Digital Asset Management systems.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve signed with Microsoft as a Principal Software Engineering Manager. I&amp;rsquo;m joining Microsoft because they are doing enterprise Open Source the Right Way, and I want to be a part of it. This is a sentence that I never believed I would write or say, so I want to explain.
First I have to acknowledge the history. I co-founded my first tech company just as the Halloween documents were leaked.</description>

      <title>Stop waiting for Feeds module: how to import RSS in Drupal 8</title>

      <description>How do you import an RSS feed into entities with Drupal 8? In Drupal 6 and 7, you probably used the Feeds module. Feeds 7 made it easy (-ish) to click together a configuration that matches an RSS (or any XML, or CSV, or OPML, etc) source to a Drupal entity type, maps source data into Drupal fields, and runs an import with the site Cron. Where has that functionality gone in D8?</description>

      <description>The Crellpocalypse in the Drupal world last week has shaken the entire community. This event and its handling have called our fundamental values and structures into question. We&amp;rsquo;ve had fights on social media, calls for Dries to step down, and valuable contributors stepping away from the community. I have friends on every side of the situation, but all I can think is: This seems like the perfect time for a singing, dancing, spandexed pageant about the Drupal community.</description>

      <title>Between the cracks of decoupled (Drupal) architecture</title>

      <description>In any decoupled architecture, people tend to focus on the pieces that will fit together. But what nobody ever tells you is: watch out for the cracks!
The cracks are the integration points between the different components. It&amp;rsquo;s not GraphQL as a communication layer; it&amp;rsquo;s that no one thinks to log GraphQL inconsistencies when they occur. It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s my development environment&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;how do these three development environments work on my localhost at the same time?</description>

      <description>A year ago I proposed a session for Drupalcon Mumbai and Drupalcon New Orleans, called &amp;ldquo;The best of both worlds&amp;rdquo;. It promised to show attendees how to write Drupal 8 code for Drupal 7 sites. I never ended up giving the session, but this week I got an email asking for more information. So in case it ever comes up again, here&amp;rsquo;s my own collection of resources on the subject.</description>

      <description>About a month and a half ago, I left my position at Forum One to start work on a project with Amazee Labs. Yes, a month and a half is an eternity in Internet-Time, but better to blog about it late than not at all!
I loved my position at Forum One. I got to work with worthwhile clients like Oxfam and United Way, I got to solve interesting and tricky Drupal problems, and I got to work with some truly brilliant colleagues.</description>

      <title>How Drupal should handle client-side framework obsolescence</title>

      <description>Today I read a great blog post from Dries: Should we decouple Drupal with a client side framework?. As usual, Dries puts a lot of thought into his writing, and braves a shitstorm of responses by laying his thinking bare while he&amp;rsquo;s still mulling it over. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist adding to the storm.
I completely agree that Drupal would benefit from figuring out a standardized approach to decoupled front ends. I think Dries is spot-on in supporting a &amp;ldquo;progressive decoupling&amp;rdquo; model as a great best-of-both-worlds response that can happen within 8.</description>

      <description>Last night (my time) I got the good news over twitter:
That&amp;rsquo;s right, Drupal 8 has it&amp;rsquo;s first release. But what does that mean? Is it done? Can I start using it yet? What kind of changes are coming? Will dawehner get to sleep, at last?
Are we there yet? Despite all the rejoicing on social media, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the final release for Drupal 8 - it&amp;rsquo;s only the first Release Candidate.</description>

      <description>One of the most exciting parts about the switch to Drupal 8 is the rapprochement of the Drupal community with the rest of PHP. This weekend I spoke at the Dutch PHP Conference in Amsterdam, where I got to be part of the vanguard of Drupalists reconnecting with the larger PHP world. The experience had a big impact on my perspective of the future of Drupal as a platform and as a community.</description>

      <title>How to build a new source for Drupal Migrate 8</title>

      <description>This week I wanted to accomplish a task in Drupal 8 that would be simple in Drupal 7: Import several CSV files, each one related to the others by taxonomy terms. Most importantly, I wanted to do it with Migrate module.
Migrate in Drupal 7 is a fantastic piece of code. It is not designed to be used from the GUI, rather, it provides a framework of &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;destination&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;migration&amp;rdquo; classes so that even the most convoluted migration is 90% written for you.</description>

      <title>Bug: Multilingual Auto Label will break your Entity Static Cache</title>

      <description>This is an important one to note: If you use the popular Automatic Entity Label module on a multilingual site, it will break your paths because of an interaction with Drupal&amp;rsquo;s built in object cache. I looked at this briefly a few months ago and ran out of time, but my (badass) colleague bburg figured it out this week.
For now, the only solution is a slow one - we clear static entity caches when we generate multilingual titles.</description>

      <description>A quick note to all the Drupalists in the DC general area - Forum One is trying to put together a D8 core sprint in their DC office space. They&amp;rsquo;re coordinating with the DC Meetup group to try and spread the word to as many community members as possible!
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a code sprint before, it&amp;rsquo;s basically a coding party. Developers get together and help each other contribute better and faster by reviewing code on the spot, mentoring each other, and generally working in small ad-hoc groups.</description>

      <description>So you have authenticated user traffic you want to cache? Good - you&amp;rsquo;re on the right post. This post is a walk through for caching content for authenticated users in Drupal 7. We will be using the Authcache suite of modules. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet, I strongly recommend you check out my last post, Authenticated User Caching Concepts in Drupal 7.
Our goal is a simple authenticated user caching system based on Authcache&amp;rsquo;s AJAX implementation, with a Memcached backend.</description>

      <guid>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/blog/2014/06/09/authenticated-user-caching-in-drupal/</guid>
      <description>Drupal has a wide variety of highly effective solutions for caching anonymous user content. The typical setup is APC, Memcached or Redis, and Varnish in front, and this can easily serve thousands of concurrent anonymous users. There is excellent documentation out there discussing this kind of simple caching.
But what about authenticated users? You can cache elements of the page using a method like Render cache, Entity Cache, or Views Content Cache.</description>

Organizer Lauri Eskola deserves tremendous credit for taking this camp to the next level. They doubled their attendance from last year, attracted positive attention from some great notables in the global Drupal world, and got their local community energized to engage more. At all the various after parties there were frequent toasts of &amp;ldquo;one of the best Drupalcamps in the world!</description>

      <description>A few months ago I posted about how to create a custom Panels pane, a critical reference for anyone who uses Panels layouts. The other part of the toolkit for quick and awesome layouts is the Display Suite module. With DS you can create new &amp;ldquo;Display modes&amp;rdquo; for your content, to be reused around the site. For example, on one recent site I had four standard ways to display my nodes: Full, Teaser, Mini-Teaser, and Search Result.</description>

      <description>Today is the last day of Drupal Dev Days in Szeged, Hungary, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never been more full of the &amp;ldquo;Drupal spirit!&amp;rdquo;
One of Drupal&amp;rsquo;s greatest strengths is the closness of its&amp;rsquo; community, how friendly and accepting they can be. Drupalcons are highlight events for many, not because of the learning as much as because of the social track: the chance to see old friends and make new ones. Even more important is the chance to experience in person this incredibly friendly community.</description>

And I&amp;rsquo;ve also ignored the warning message every time before, but today I thought I&amp;rsquo;d check it out:

      <description>Install profiles are a great way to throw together a functional Drupal site really quickly. In Drupal 6, an Install Profile was just a blueprint for setting up a site really quickly. What you did after the site was installed was your own business! But in Drupal 7 profiles are much more integrated with core. The assumption is that when you use an install profile, you want to rely on the profile&amp;rsquo;s maintainer for all your updates.</description>

      <description>Lots of sites are now built with the &amp;ldquo;Panels everywhere&amp;rdquo; method, using Panels and Panelizer to configure modular layouts in the Drupal GUI. These modules come with lots of great default Panes, and create even more defaults based on your existing Blocks and Views. But there&amp;rsquo;s always a case for a custom Pane.
As usual, I&amp;rsquo;ll assume that you have an empty custom module called mymodule, with only a .info and a .</description>

      <description>You&amp;rsquo;re building a View, but you can&amp;rsquo;t get that field to display the way you want it to. Or filter, or sort. Or maybe you have some data in a custom table that you want to include in the View. So you look for a contributed module, and Views PHP looks like the answer to your problem! Until you read the module page, where it says:
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;it is highly advisable to use regular handlers and plugins when available (or even to create one yourself).</description>

      <description>One of the big advantages to using the Context module is how totally extensible it is. Not only can you use and re-use the built in conditions, you can write your own. This brings all the power of the custom PHP evaluation method of block placement, but in a structure that makes your code re-usable, contributable, versioned, and standards-based. Writing a custom Context Condition is also a great template for how to integrate custom behaviors in many of the more complex Drupal modules such as Views and Search_API.</description>

      <title>Announcing the Resource Conflict Drupal module</title>
      <link>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2012/06/announcing-resource-conflict-drupal.html</link>

      <guid>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2012/06/announcing-resource-conflict-drupal.html</guid>
      <description>{% raw %} I recently took over an aging Drupal module, Resource Conflict. It had a D6 version with a lot of outstanding bugs in the queue... I started by simply rewriting it for D7 and my specific use case, but ended up in a discussion with the module&#39;s old maintainer about a total rewrite for&amp;nbsp;Entities&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Rules. So that&#39;s what I did, and I just released the 7.x-3.x-dev version.
Resource Conflict USED to be a module that detected booking conflicts in resources, and threw a form error.</description>

      <title>Drupal developers&#39; toolkit: handy tools and functions to make your life easier</title>

      <description>{% raw %} Drupal is big and complex, and no matter how good you are, you will need to debug. Before you get started coding for a Drupal site, you should download and enable the very useful devel module on your dev site. Go ahead, I&#39;ll wait.
This primer covers all the tools that I&#39;ll use in later tutorials on this blog. In the real world I end up using 5-6 of these guys regularly.</description>

      <title>Drupal quick learning guides: Custom modules</title>

      <guid>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2012/04/drupal-quick-learning-guides-custom.html</guid>
      <description>{% raw %} Ah, it&#39;s nice to be done with the basic structure stuff. At this point, I&#39;m going to assume that you know the basics of how to administer a Drupal site. You understand the file structure, you know where to go to download themes and modules, and you know how to make sites out of the big pieces you can find that way. Awesome. This is where it gets fun.</description>

      <description>{% raw %} I&#39;ve been lax about posting lately, and to make this easier on myself I think I&#39;ll post a bunch of quick guides for basic coding procedures with Drupal. Simple things and concepts, explored in just enough detail for you to understand how it works, resource links so you can actually go and put it into practice. The first thing you need to understand about Drupal is the structure.</description>

      <title>On Drupal Entities, or how Organic Groups and Taxonomy are the same thing</title>
      <link>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2012/03/on-drupal-entities-or-how-organic.html</link>

      <guid>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2012/03/on-drupal-entities-or-how-organic.html</guid>
      <description>{% raw %} I&#39;m a big fan of the new Entities model for Drupal. I&#39;ve been working a lot with it lately, and it makes a lot of sense... but my favorite part is how it keeps blowing away my old assumptions, inherited from 7 years of Drupal experience. Here&#39;s a big one that got me recently: Organic Groups is useless, because it&#39;s basically Taxonomy with a couple of neat add-ons.</description>

      <title>The complete Drupal Cache - Serving HTTP and HTTPS content with Varnish</title>
      <link>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2011/05/complete-drupal-cache-serving-http-and.html</link>

      <guid>https://ohthehugemanatee.org/2011/05/complete-drupal-cache-serving-http-and.html</guid>
      <description>{% raw %} Varnish is a fantastic caching proxy, commonly used for CMSes. It&#39;s not uncommon to see benchmarks boasting 300-500 page loads per second - I&#39;ve seen benches up to 5000 hits per second. That&#39;s faster than serving flat HTML from Apache; we&#39;re talking about a serious benefit to your server load here.
Part of Varnish&#39;s tremendous speed comes from how lean it is. At only 58,000 lines of code, it&#39;s very lightweight.</description>
