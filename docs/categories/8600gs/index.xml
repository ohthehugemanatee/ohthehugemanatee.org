      <description>{% raw %} This weekend a friend asked me to have a look at his HP DV9500 laptop. &amp;nbsp;It was having trouble - when you turned it on, the screen showed nothing but a solid grey with a few thin black bars. &amp;nbsp;The grey increased in intensity as the system ran, until it ran off the colors that the display knew how to show.
Clearly, there was a problem with the video card.</description>
