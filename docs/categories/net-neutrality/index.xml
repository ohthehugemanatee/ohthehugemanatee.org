      <description>{% raw %} I know no one reads this blog but me, but I may as well put this up here. &amp;nbsp;Net Neutrality: I&#39;m for it.
Steve Wozniak has an excellent Open Letter up on the Atlantic about the issue. &amp;nbsp;He takes the examples of public goods such as roadworks and compares them favorably to privately managed utilities like Cable TV and Internet. Personally, I think his letter is a much more effective critique of the FCC than it is a championing of the public works model of construction.</description>
