      <title>Another cryptic Ruby message</title>

      <description>Ruby on Rails drives me nuts, and today I found another example of why: the cryptic error messages. After a server update, my chiliproject/redmine site refused to start. The error message was
 &amp;ldquo;Object is not missing constant Issue!&amp;rdquo;
 What does that even mean? It took me a little while to understand that Issue in this context is the Redmine object &amp;ldquo;Issue&amp;rdquo;. But still, &amp;ldquo;Object is not missing constant X&amp;rdquo; isn&amp;rsquo;t much help.</description>

      <description>{% raw %} Redmine is a fantastic project management tool for technically oriented organizations. &amp;nbsp;At my job, we use it to manage 30-50 active projects at a time, as well as the back history of several hundred projects. &amp;nbsp;Oddly enough, the normal installation process puts it on port 3000 . &amp;nbsp;We had some trouble with developers&#39; ISPs not allowing HTTPS traffic over non-standard ports, so we had to move redmine onto port 443 along with the rest of the SSL traffic.</description>
