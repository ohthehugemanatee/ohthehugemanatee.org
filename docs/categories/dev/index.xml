      <description>Another day, another Hacker News post complaining about estimation in software build projects. These articles and comment sections should come with a trigger warning for armchair speculation. Project management and time estimation are fields of serious research. Drawing conclusions from your personal experience, with no idea what the research says, is as silly as writing your experience that the world is obviously flat.
Estimation is actually well understood in academic project management.</description>

      <description>Recently some of my work on prenotes came up, and reminded me that I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to post favorite moments here for some time. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, a prenote is a session before the keynote of a conference or event. During that session, notables from across the community put on a humorous show of parody lyrics karaoke, terribly scripted dialogue, and general silliness. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to kick off an event, and really sets the tone if you&amp;rsquo;re into flat-hierarchy and openness for newbies.</description>

      <description>My team&amp;rsquo;s work with Volkswagen on an autonomous driving simulation environments just turned into a new Azure Well-Architected page, which makes this a good time to add some behind-the-scenes commentary from real world experience. The architecture recommended there came from a lot of discovery and experimentation work, and suits quite a broad case that I think is not well represented (yet) in cloud computing products.
The challenge Testing and CI-style validation in autonomous driving development are a tricky challenge.</description>

      <description>What do most people do with their old computers? I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at getting rid of mine. They were all repurposed into servers, running whatever key services for my household I could think of at the time. This year I decided to move out of the &amp;ldquo;old sysadmin&amp;rdquo; patterns of my roots, and try running my homelab in a more modern way. That&amp;rsquo;s right: I set up a kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <title>5 Project Manager Comments That Out You as an Amateur</title>

      <description>A lot of the project managers you&amp;rsquo;ll meet in technical consulting are new. That&amp;rsquo;s OK! The number of developers - and correspondingly, their project managers - is growing exponentially from year to year. Even if we could assign everyone a mentor with at least a year of experience, there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enough mentors to go around. A lot of people are learning as they go, and land in a role because someone thinks they have an aptitude.</description>

      <title>Serverless is the MS Access of the Future</title>

      <description>Controversial opinion time: the usefulness of what we presently call &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; will always be limited to simple use cases. It is a great choice for glue code or simple projects, but it will never be the best choice for even medium complexity development problems. Containers and similar technologies will eat its lunch the same way RDBMSes ate MSAccess&#39;.
The benefits of serverless are real. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about infrastructure, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about scaling or availability.</description>
