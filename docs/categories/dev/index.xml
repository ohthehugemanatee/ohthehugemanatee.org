      <description>My team&amp;rsquo;s work with Volkswagen on an autonomous driving simulation environments just turned into a new Azure Well-Architected page, which makes this a good time to add some behind-the-scenes commentary from real world experience. The architecture recommended there came from a lot of discovery and experimentation work, and suits quite a broad case that I think is not well represented (yet) in cloud computing products.
The challenge Testing and CI-style validation in autonomous driving development are a tricky challenge.</description>

      <description>What do most people do with their old computers? I&amp;rsquo;ve never been good at getting rid of mine. They were all repurposed into servers, running whatever key services for my household I could think of at the time. This year I decided to move out of the &amp;ldquo;old sysadmin&amp;rdquo; patterns of my roots, and try running my homelab in a more modern way. That&amp;rsquo;s right: I set up a kubernetes cluster.</description>

      <description>Controversial opinion time: the usefulness of what we presently call &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; will always be limited to simple use cases. It is a great choice for glue code or simple projects, but it will never be the best choice for even medium complexity development problems. Containers and similar technologies will eat its lunch the same way RDBMSes ate MSAccess&#39;.
The benefits of serverless are real. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about infrastructure, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about scaling or availability.</description>
