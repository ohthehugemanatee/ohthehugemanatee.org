      <description>Dear Wired - I read your post about the changes in ad blocker policy on your site. Thanks for writing in such an open and respectful tone; it&amp;rsquo;s clear you care about your readers and want to find a reasonable way forward.
Unfortunately the post fails to address the REASONS that your readers use ad blockers. If only you had gone a little bit farther in the post and offered specific promises in exchange for being whitelisted, I think you would keep a much larger proportion of your readers.</description>
