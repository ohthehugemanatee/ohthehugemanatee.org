      <description>How do you import an RSS feed into entities with Drupal 8? In Drupal 6 and 7, you probably used the Feeds module. Feeds 7 made it easy (-ish) to click together a configuration that matches an RSS (or any XML, or CSV, or OPML, etc) source to a Drupal entity type, maps source data into Drupal fields, and runs an import with the site Cron. Where has that functionality gone in D8?</description>

      <description>In any decoupled architecture, people tend to focus on the pieces that will fit together. But what nobody ever tells you is: watch out for the cracks!
The cracks are the integration points between the different components. It&amp;rsquo;s not GraphQL as a communication layer; it&amp;rsquo;s that no one thinks to log GraphQL inconsistencies when they occur. It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s my development environment&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;how do these three development environments work on my localhost at the same time?</description>
