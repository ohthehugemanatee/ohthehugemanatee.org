      <description>{% raw %} I have had all sorts of trouble with the wireless situation in my apartment. &amp;nbsp;The layout of the place is such that the kitchen sits in between the two major rooms (living room and bedroom), and I swear those kitchen walls must be made of lead. &amp;nbsp;No wireless signal seems to get through. &amp;nbsp;I have phone jacks for ADSL in the living room and bedroom, nothing in between.</description>
