      <description>Another day, another Hacker News post complaining about estimation in software build projects.

Even if we could assign everyone a mentor with at least a year of experience, there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enough mentors to go around. A lot of people are learning as they go, and land in a role because someone thinks they have an aptitude.</description>
