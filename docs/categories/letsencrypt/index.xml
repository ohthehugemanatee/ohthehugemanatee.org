      <description>If you believe the docs and the twitters, there is no way to automate letsencrypt certificates updates on platform.sh. You have to create the certificates manually, upload them manually, and maintain them manually.
But as readers of this blog know, the docs are only the start of the story. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed working with platform.sh with one of my private clients, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe that with all the flexibility - all the POWER - letsencrypt was really out of reach.</description>
