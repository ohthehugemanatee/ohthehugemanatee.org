      <description>I run BTRFS on my root filesystem (on Linux), mostly for the quick snapshot and restore functionality. Yesterday I ran into a common problem: my drive was suddenly full. I went from 4GB of free space on my system drive to 0 in an instant, causing all sorts of chaos on my system.
This problem happens to lots of people because BTRFS doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a linear relationship to &amp;ldquo;free space available&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>In the airport last week, my laptop stopped booting.
I have a 2012 Macbook Pro - yes, that coveted &amp;ldquo;last good model&amp;rdquo; - and it runs Ubuntu Linux. It&amp;rsquo;s my roving office as I travel the world to conferences, performances, and job sites. So when I started it up at JFK airport this week and got a gray screen of death, I was a little concerned.
I tried starting into Startup Manager by holding the &amp;ldquo;Option&amp;rdquo; key.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I posted about my frustrations getting El Capitan working with my relatively simple developer needs. At the time I complained about the direction Apple is going. One of these days, I threatened, I would jump back to Linux as a primary desktop environment.
This week I read about everyone&amp;rsquo;s problems getting OSX Sierra going, and I decided it was time to take the plunge. Apple, I completely understand the direction you are going with your environment.</description>
