      <description>A lot is made of so-called &amp;ldquo;rockstar developers&amp;rdquo; in any given language or framework. They have a seemingly magical knowledge of the language and API, finding obscure methods and writing best-practice code as if by instinct. I&amp;rsquo;d like to lift the curtain on this: it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to be this kind of rock star. You can do it, too&amp;hellip; even without a fancy computer science degree. If you know how to code in a given language, you just need 3 skills and some patience.</description>

It promised to show attendees how to write Drupal 8 code for Drupal 7 sites. I never ended up giving the session, but this week I got an email asking for more information. So in case it ever comes up again, here&amp;rsquo;s my own collection of resources on the subject.</description>
