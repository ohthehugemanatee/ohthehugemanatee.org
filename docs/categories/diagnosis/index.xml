      <description>{% raw %} After my evening spent getting my DD-WRT firmware to a stable version (as opposed to the version recommended by the DD-WRT website), I had hoped that I had seen the end of my wireless issues.
No such luck.
I have definitely seen an improvement - in a ping flood test, I&#39;m only seeing 0.5% dropped packets now, which is an improvement over the 2% I was seeing before.</description>
