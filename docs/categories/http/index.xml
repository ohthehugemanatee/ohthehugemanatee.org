      <description>My client bought a domain name based on her favorite username when she was young. Like any teenager, she didn&amp;rsquo;t choose the best name. But SpongeBobLover16 (name changed to preserve her anonymity) wanted to exert her online independence. She decided she would give her real name domain to SpongeBobLover16.com in a 301 redirect. Her parents told her she should always use a 302, but she ignored their advice. &amp;ldquo;I remember it felt so good,&amp;rdquo; she says today, &amp;ldquo;but now I have to live with that mistake every day.</description>
