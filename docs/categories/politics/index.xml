      <description>Chinese censors are in the news this weekend: Blizzard banned a grandmaster Hearthstone player for supporting Hong Kong in an interview, South Park was added to the &amp;ldquo;banned&amp;rdquo; list for their critique of Chinese censorship in Hollywood, and an NBA franchise owner&amp;rsquo;s job was on the line for a pro-HK tweet. Increasingly, Western companies are finding themselves up against the wall to prioritize western liberal values against access to the enormous Chinese market.</description>

      <description>The proposal for a directive on copyright in the digital single market is disastrous for the EU economy, culture, and democracy in the digital world. It is particularly bad for my country of Germany, as a leading light in Europe in all three areas. I am writing all of my MEPs listed in support of this impossibly bad proposal.
The German and European economies would be terribly damaged by this article, which effectively rules out small and medium sized competition in favor of the largest incumbents.</description>

      <description>{% raw %} I know no one reads this blog but me, but I may as well put this up here. &amp;nbsp;Net Neutrality: I&#39;m for it.
Steve Wozniak has an excellent Open Letter up on the Atlantic about the issue. &amp;nbsp;He takes the examples of public goods such as roadworks and compares them favorably to privately managed utilities like Cable TV and Internet. Personally, I think his letter is a much more effective critique of the FCC than it is a championing of the public works model of construction.</description>
