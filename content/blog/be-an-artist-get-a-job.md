One of the most insidious lies that is destroying classical music - and I presume the other classical arts - is that you are only allowed to earn money from your art. Not only is it a lie, it is a lie that actively destroys your ability to be an artist. More than anything else, *this* is the root cause of the boring, inoffensive approach to music that has robbed so many classical performances and performers of their passion.

I differentiate between *artists* and *players* (or singers, if you like). Any professional-calibre musician must achieve a very high level of technical proficiency on their instrument. Beyond that however, a player focuses on that proficiency as their primary goal. They hit all the notes precisely, obey the dynamics, follow the conductor and director, and they do it all the Right Way. An artist on the other hand, has their own opinions that often conflict with the conductor or director, their own interpretations that challenge the composer, and performs anything but "by the book". I don't mean to disparage players; we need them! But vanishingly few people buy tickets to see a display of technical prowess and precise execution. We need artists, and there are vanishingly few of them.

Examples of artists in my own field (opera) are Mario Del Monaco, whose singing sometimes literally descended into screaming. Or Renata Tebaldi, who's best Bbs were supposed to be B naturals.
