When I joined Microsoft, I knew that I would need to develop new skills to navigate my new, unbelievably large workplace. Here are my pro tips so far for people who are new to large corporate life.

## Separate your local and global environment

Microsoft has something like 190,000 employees at the moment. That's a mid-sized city of full-timers, in every job imaginable. Once you're inside, you can spend your whole life at one megacorp and still have a wonderful and varied career.

This means it's time to start separating your feelings about your company, from your feelings about your present workplace environment. They are related, but separate. If your local environment isn't good for you, you need to understand if that's just a problem in one management line, one department, or the whole company. 

In other places I've talked about the implicit deal that employment at any company offers: how does the company try to compensate you? Is it purely cash money? Do they take care of your family? Let you work on the coolest tech? This kind of attribute belongs to the overall company, and will be true in whatever roles you find.

Separately consider your local environment. Do you like your manager's leadership style? Does it seem to align with other managers around you, or are they incongruous with the rest of your department? These kinds of questions will help you understand your next career steps.

## Always think about your next steps
