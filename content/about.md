My name is Campbell Vertesi; I’m Microsoft's Global Partner Strategy ISV CTO for Red Hat, and an opera singer.

I’ve been working with computers for 24 years. I started with desktop repair, moved into sysadmin work, and eventually discovered Drupal 4.1 and the beginnings of the web application world. Since then I’ve been in most roles in the web consultant ecosystem: coder, themer, project manager, information architect, technical lead, CEO, and CTO. I’ve presented at dozens of software conferences, often on the main stage or as a keynote.

As a consultant - or something like it - I've been fortunate enough to work with great organizations like the Jane Goodall Institute, the Mozilla Foundation, the EPA, the United Way, and Oxfam International. I’ve helped out big commercial organizations like Volkswagen, Ringier Axel Springer, and E.ON. Along the way I've stayed committed to open source as a development methodology and ethical way to create software.

The rest of the stuff I do is scattered around the Internet and real life. I’m co-founder of the opera band [The Cast](https://thecastmusic.com/), bringing crowds to their feet with awesome classical music. I speak English, French, Italian, and German, and I love to travel. I love to learn anything new, so I get hobbies like most people get colds. I have three awesome kids, and a great life here in Berlin, Germany.
